For RCD Espanyol, the answer arrived in the 86th minute on a cold January afternoon in Cornellà. It came off the boot of Dani Olmo. It was followed shortly by a Robert Lewandowski dagger.</p><p>6,160 days.</p><p>That is how long it has been since Espanyol last tasted a La Liga victory over their cross-town rivals. Since February 2009, the world has changed, empires have fallen, and Barcelona has cycled through legendary eras. Yet, one thing remains static: the <em>Derbi Barceloní</em> belongs to the Blaugrana.</p><p>This wasn't supposed to be just another routine win for Hansi Flick’s side. Espanyol entered this match on a blistering five-game winning streak. They sat fifth in the table. They were playing the best football seen at the RCDE Stadium in a generation. The stage was set for an upset. The atmosphere was poisonous. The security was at an all-time high. But when the dust settled on this 0-2 result, the "Periquitos" were left with nothing but bitterness and the haunting image of their former son, Joan Garcia, standing like a titan between the sticks for the enemy.</p><h2 style="color:#2ecc71;">The Hard Truth: Tribalism Over Talent</h2><p>Why does this trending topic dominate the conversation today? Because it wasn't just a game of soccer. It was a psychological war that Espanyol lost long before the opening whistle.</p><p>The investigative reality of this matchup reveals a club in Espanyol that is currently obsessed with its own victimhood. Leading up to the match, the club took the radical step of banning Barcelona club symbols and jerseys from the home stands. They wanted to create a fortress of pure hate. They targeted Joan Garcia, the goalkeeper who traded the blue and white for the garnet and blue. They called him a "rat." They printed posters. They hissed every time he touched the ball.</p><p>It failed. It failed because hate is not a tactical system.</p><p>The hard truth is that Espanyol’s internal culture is currently focused more on hurting Barcelona than on helping themselves. When your veteran players, like the 33-year-old Pere Milla, are going on record saying they would rather "step on" a teenager like Lamine Yamal than their former teammate, you have a leadership crisis. That isn't grit. That’s desperation. Barcelona didn't win this match because they had more money or higher-rated players on a video game. They won because they remained professional while Espanyol chose chaos.</p><h2 style="color:#2ecc71;">Tactical Breakdown: Flick’s High Line vs. Gonzalez’s Grit</h2><p>Hansi Flick is a man of ice. He didn't care about the whistling. He didn't care about the hostile "rat" chants. He came to Cornellà with a specific blueprint: suffocate the midfield and dare Espanyol to beat the offside trap.</p><p>Espanyol’s manager, Manolo Gonzalez, actually set his team up brilliantly for the first seventy minutes. He knew Barca would dominate possession. He accepted that. He deployed a compact 4-4-2 that shifted into a 5-4-1 when Yamal and Olmo drifted wide. For long stretches, it worked. Espanyol had the better chances. They broke through the high line four times.</p><p>Each time, they met Joan Garcia.</p><p>Garcia’s performance was a masterclass in positional awareness. He didn't just make saves; he demoralized his former fans. He plucked crosses out of the air with a nonchalance that felt like a slap in the face to the ultras behind the goal. His six saves weren't just statistical data points; they were bricks in a wall that Espanyol couldn't climb.</p><p>Then came the substitutions. Flick saw the fatigue in Espanyol’s fullbacks. He pushed the tempo. Dani Olmo, who had been struggling with discomfort all week, found a pocket of space in the 86th minute. It was a classic Barca goal—quick horizontal passes that suddenly turned vertical. One touch, a swivel, and the back of the net bulged.</p><p>Espanyol collapsed. When you play a game based on emotional intensity, once the emotion breaks, the structure follows. Lewandowski’s 90th-minute goal was almost academic. A simple tap-in that served as a final "keep quiet" to a stadium that had spent two hours screaming insults.</p><h2 style="color:#2ecc71;">Fan Reaction: A City Divided by Bitter Blood</h2><p>The digital fallout of this match is a fascinating study in contrast. On one side, you have the Barca faithful, who are mocking the 6,160-day drought with ruthless efficiency. They view Espanyol not as a rival, but as a nuisance. To them, the "Derbi" is barely a derby anymore; it’s a scheduled three points.</p><p>On the other side, the Espanyol supporters are incensed. But their anger is misplaced. They are attacking Joan Garcia for "betrayal" and Pere Milla is being heralded as a hero by the hardline ultras for his "step on Lamine" comments.</p><p>The reaction on social media, particularly Reddit’s r/soccer and r/Barca, shows a clear divide. Neutral fans are disgusted by the treatment of Lamine Yamal. The kid is a teenager. He is the future of Spanish football. To have a veteran player publicly suggest physical violence against him—and to have a fanbase cheer that suggestion—is a dark look for La Liga.</p><p>The "rat" narrative surrounding Garcia is equally intense. Espanyol fans feel that a homegrown player moving to their biggest rival is the ultimate sin. But from a professional standpoint, who can blame him? He went from a club fighting for top-five relevance to a club that is a global powerhouse. He kept a clean sheet and won Man of the Match. That is the best way to answer a crowd that calls you a traitor.</p><h3 style="color:#2ecc71;">Historical Context: The Pig’s Head and the Politics of Identity</h3><p>To understand why this match felt like a war, we have to look back. Manolo Gonzalez, the Espanyol coach, made a pointed reference to Luis Figo’s return to the Camp Nou in the early 2000s. He told the press that Barcelona has no right to lecture anyone on "hostile environments" after they threw a pig's head at a player.</p><p>He isn't wrong about the history, but he’s wrong about the context. The rivalry between these two is deeply political. Historically, Barcelona represented the oppressed Catalan identity during the dictatorship era. Espanyol, as the name suggests (Spanish), was often seen as the club of the central authority.</p><p>Even though those political lines have blurred in 2026, the tribalism remains. This is why Gerard Piqué used to mock them by calling them "Espanyol de Cornellà," implying they weren't even a team from the city of Barcelona anymore. The "sprinkler incident" of May 2025, where Espanyol turned on the pitch irrigation while Barca players celebrated the title, is still fresh. This rivalry is built on small, petty acts of vengeance.</p><h2 style="color:#2ecc71;">Prediction: The Road to the Title and the Battle for Europe</h2><p>What happens next?</p><p>For Barcelona, this win is a statement. They didn't play their best football. They were harassed, insulted, and physically targeted. Yet, they won 0-2. That is the hallmark of champions. Hansi Flick has turned this squad into a machine that doesn't need to be "on" for 90 minutes to win. They just need five minutes of brilliance. I predict Barcelona will widen their lead at the top of La Liga over the next month. Their defensive stability, led by the "traitorous" Joan Garcia, is the best in Spain right now.</p><p>As for Espanyol, they are at a crossroads. Their five-match winning streak is over. They are 5th in the table, which is still an incredible achievement for them. However, if they continue to focus on this "us against the world" siege mentality, they will burn out. They have the talent to qualify for the Champions League. They have the grit. But they need to stop worrying about what Lamine Yamal is doing on Instagram and start worrying about their own late-game defensive lapses. If they don't, they will slide back into mid-table mediocrity by March.</p><h2 style="color:#2ecc71;">Final Verdict: Class Always Outlasts Chaos</h2><p>The 177th league meeting between these two clubs proved one thing: you cannot win a derby with just your heart. You need your head.</p><p>Espanyol played with fire. They stoked a furnace of hatred in their stadium, hoping it would melt Barcelona’s resolve. Instead, they just provided the heat that forged Joan Garcia into a hero and gave Dani Olmo the spark to finish them off.</p><p>The comments by Pere Milla regarding Lamine Yamal are a stain on the club's season. The ban on Barcelona jerseys was a petty move that showed a lack of confidence. When you spend all your energy trying to stop the opponent from feeling at home, you forget to play your own game.</p><p>Barcelona is the king of the city. They have been for 6,160 days. Based on the tactical and mental gulf we saw in this match, they will be for 6,000 more. Espanyol is a good team—maybe even a great one this year—but they are still a club defined by their hatred of another, while Barcelona is a club defined by its own pursuit of excellence. That is why the scoreline was 0-2. That is why it will always be 0-2 until Espanyol decides to play soccer instead of war.</p></article></div><footer>© 2025 Sport999.
